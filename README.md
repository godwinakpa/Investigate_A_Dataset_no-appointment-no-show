# no-appointment-no-show
Udacity nanodegree project1

The No Show Appointments data piqued my interest for this project because it seems the realest to me and would enable 
me put theories to practice easily. In this project, I will be investigating and analyzing data associated with the
 Medical_Appointments_No_Shows data. The dataset details information from over 100k medical appointments in Brazil and 
is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The analysis is focused on finding
 trends influencing patients to show or not show up to appointments. At the end of this section, I used the Exploratory 
Data Analysis approach to answer specific questions like: How specific features (age, scholarship and sms_received) 
relate to the no_show for appointment. The data set include set of characteristics about each patient (records) such as:
'ScheduledDay': Days on which the patients set up their appointments.

'Neighborhood': Indicates the location of the hospital.

'Scholarship': Indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brazil's welfare program called 'Bolsa Familia'.

'No-show': No if the patient showed up to their appointment, and Yes if they didn't.

Conclusions\
Having perused through the Medical Appointments No show database, i have succeded to solve a few problems within 
the dataset such as; converting wrong data types, correcting wrong attribute names as well as changing the data 
value format for the dependent variable. I have also investigated most of independent variables in the dataset 
and made a few observations comparing them to each other as well as to the dependent one (no_show).This happens 
to be my first project in this skillset and thus i was only able to perform an exploratory analysis, thus, my 
findings are tentative. it is imperative that the data be investigated much further with advanced statistical 
and analytics tools to potentially reveal new insights and correlations embedded in the dataframe.

Observations\
Avg age of the patient is 37 years old

The oldest patient is 115 years old

There are not many patients who have Diabetes Alcoholism or Handcap

There is less than half of the SMS messages recieved

About 20% of patients missed their appointments in each age class.

Having a scholarship has a significant inflence on patients showing up for their appointments.

Chart Analysis\
It is more likely for patients with lower ages(compared to the median) to show up for Appointments 
than those with Higher ages.

It is certain that, patients who has scholarships showed up for Appointments more than those without
any scholarship.

As seen from the chart, patients who receive sms showed up for Appointments more than those who did
not received sms.

About 20% of patients didn't show up for their appointments, while those who showed up for their
appointments make up for 80% of total patients .
