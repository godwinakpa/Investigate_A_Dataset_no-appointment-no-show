# no-appointment-no-show
Udacity nanodegree project1

The No Show Appointments data piqued my interest for this project because it seems the realest to me and would enable 
me put theories to practice easily. In this project, I will be investigating and analyzing data associated with the
 Medical_Appointments_No_Shows data. The dataset details information from over 100k medical appointments in Brazil and 
is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The analysis is focused on finding
 trends influencing patients to show or not show up to appointments. At the end of this section, I used the Exploratory 
Data Analysis approach to answer specific questions like: How specific features (age, scholarship and sms_received) 
relate to the no_show for appointment. The data set include set of characteristics about each patient (records) such as:
'ScheduledDay': Days on which the patients set up their appointments.

'Neighborhood': Indicates the location of the hospital.

'Scholarship': Indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brazil's welfare program called 'Bolsa Familia'.

'No-show': No if the patient showed up to their appointment, and Yes if they didn't.
